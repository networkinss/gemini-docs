# Gemini as Dependency

The best way to fully use Gemini features is to integrate it in your project as a dependency. In this way you can register to Gemini events and callback to customize and improve default Gemini API behaviors. For example you can:

* have some calculated fields in your APIs
* perform complex validation
* register completely custom APIs and controllers and use core Gemini features such as the Entity Manager
