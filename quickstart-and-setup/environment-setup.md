# Environment Setup

The easiest way to run or develop with Gemini is to use the **Docker** configuration you can find in the project ****avoiding ****the installation of other software except Java. Here  is a quick tutorial \(all the commands are explained below in the documentation\)

### **Requirements**

**NB**: If you don't want to use Docker you need the following tools in your machine:

* Postgresql 11+
* Java 9+
* Gradle 5+

### **Docker Development Environment**

Start docker services is simple, docker compose works for you for all the volumes, services and variables mapping. 

```text
# from gemini project root (you can find on Github)
$ cd docker/dev
$ docker-compose up -d

# Environment is now ready
# goto http://127.0.0.1:8081 - PgAdmin
# goto http://127.0.0.1:8082 - SwaggerUI
# follow instruction below to Start Gemini
```

Inside the `docker/dev/` directory you have the docker-compose configuration and a real working directory environment that you can use or modify. The default environment has the following services:

* **Postgresql 11+** database
  * port=5432 - dbname=gemini - user=gemini - pwd=gemini
  * Spring `wd/application.properties` already uses previous parameters
* **PgAdmin** to have a full control of postgres server
  * Exposed on port 8081 \([http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081/)\)
  * Login Username and Password are both `gemini`
  * The `Gemini - Docker` server configuration is provided out of the box just type the `gemini` password the first time
* **Swagger UI** to consume the Gemini APIs
  * Available on port 8082 \([http://127.0.0.1:8082](http://127.0.0.1:8082/)\)
  * Gemini autogenerated openapi definitions are automatically loaded where:
    * ALL definition lists all the Gemini resources \(also metadata and core resources\)
    * RUNTIME definiton lists only the resurces defined in the `RUNTIME.at` DSL file
