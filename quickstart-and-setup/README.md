# QuickStart and Install

Gemini has a modular structure but the artifact is always a Spring Boot application that you can run everywhere.

The easiest way to run or develop with Gemini is to use the **Docker** configuration you can find in the project \(avoiding ****the installation of other software except Java\). Then you can build/run Gemini standalone or executable. 

Here  is a quick tutorial..
