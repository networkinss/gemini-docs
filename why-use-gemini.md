# Why use Gemini

Gemini uses a different approach compared to other frameworks:

* **Model Driven API -** build APIs by conventions over configuration 
* **No Code Generation** - Gemini uses internal engine to handle entities data and web controllers
* **Out of the Box features -** CRUD APIs and OpenAPI3 Swagger Documentation
* **Flexibility** and **Customization -** developed on top of Spring, so you can register your custom controller or use Spring features as you want 
* **Dedicated Entity Manager** - Gemini doesn't use JPA and Hibernate

But the most important thing is that you can build **FULL** **REST APIs** in **minutes** starting from a Model

And if you want to add business logic or customize them you can use [Gemini Events](main-features/events-and-callbacks.md) \(and write some code of course\)
