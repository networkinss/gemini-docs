# Why use Gemini

Gemini uses a different approach compared to other frameworks:

* **No Code Generation** - Gemini uses internal engine to handle entities data and web controllers
* **Out of the Box features -** CRUD APIs and OpenAPI3 Swagger Documentation
* **Flexibility** and **Customization -** developed on top of Spring, so you can register your custom controller or use Spring features as you want 
* **Dedicated Entity Manager** - Gemini doesn't use JPA and Hibernate
